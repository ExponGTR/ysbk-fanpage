                I created this site while learning web-dev, to have something interesting to work on. I have been obsessed with Yousanbunko, especially Chikamori's angelic voice. Although I don't expect anyone to see this site ever, I will still try to continue updating it as long as possible to have a nice showcase of my favourite music group of all time.
